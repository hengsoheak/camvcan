## Description

Live Composer is a front-end WordPress page builder plugin. Front-end means you build the page directly on the page, not in the admin panel, which allows you to see exactly how the page will look like as you build it, with live feedback on every change you make.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How can I activate the page builder on a page?
When you visit a page you'll see a green "activate editor" button in the bottom right corner, click that and the page will reload in LC mode.

#### Why is the "activate editor" button missing from the homepage
In most of the cases this is because the homepage is not a real WordPress page, it’s custom content generated by the theme’s index.php. Publish a new page and set it as the homepage ( WP Admin > Settings > Reading > Front Page ). Now you can use LC on the homepage.

#### Is it compatible with any WordPress theme?
Live Composer should work with any WordPress theme created according to the standards. You can also find a few free and premium themes created specifically for this plugin: http://livecomposerplugin.com/themes/ If you start from scratch we recommend to check out a free Blank Theme.
